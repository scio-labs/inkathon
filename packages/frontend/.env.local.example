## IMPORTANT: To set-up your project:
##   → 1. Duplicate this file and rename it to `.env.local`
##   → 2. Define your preferred networks (also see https://github.com/scio-labs/use-inkathon/blob/main/src/chains.ts)
##   → 3. Make sure to also define those environment variables on your deployment
##        (i.e. see the *Deployment* section in the root `README.md`) 

## NOTE: To use those variables in the code:
##   → 1. Add them in `src/shared/environment.ts`
##   → 2. And always import `env` from `@shared/environment` (not from `process`) 

## Flag to differentiate production environments (i.e. for analytics)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_MODE=false             

## The current deployment url (i.e. useful for calling Next.js API routes)
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000         

## The default chain identifer
## IMPORTANT: Make sure to add the following for all contracts:
##   → ABIs under `/packages/contracts/deployments/{contract}/metadata.json` (auto-generated on build)
##   → Addresses for all chains under `/packages/contracts/deployments/{contract}/{chain}.ts` (auto-generated on deploy)
## NOTE: See dynamic contract imports under `src/deployments/deployments.ts`
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_CHAIN=alephzero-testnet

## Multiple supported chain identifiers (Optional)
## IMPORTANT: It's mandatory to use double quotes in the array
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_CHAINS=["alephzero-testnet"]
